# Multiclass-Fake-News-Detection-on-LIAR-PLUS
Multiclass fake news detection on the LIAR dataset involves classifying news statements into one of several fine-grained truthfulness labels, rather than a simple binary "fake" or "real"Â classification. A deep learning project for fine-grained fake news classification using the LIAR-PLUS dataset and a hybrid BiLSTM-CNN architecture.

Overview:
This project focuses on detecting and classifying fake news across six categories (true, false, mostly-true, half-true, barely-true, pants-fire) using a custom deep learning architecture combining Bidirectional LSTM and CNN layers. The model is trained and evaluated on the LIAR-PLUS dataset.
